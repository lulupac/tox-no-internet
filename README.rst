Workarounds when running ``tox`` with no internet connection.

Why
---

A few issues arise when running ``tox`` with no internet connection: 

- ``virtualenv`` will reach out to pypi to download the latest version of ``pip``, ``setuptools``, and ``wheel``, 
- ``pip`` will reach out to pypi to download dependencies, 
- if your project or one of its dependency uses the ``setuptools`` *setup_requires* keyword in its setup.py* script, ``easy_install`` will be used to fulfill these dependencies and will reach out to pypi as well, (see ``pip`` documentation on this `topic <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/#controlling-setup-requires>`__).


How it works
------------

First, set the ``TOX_PLUGIN_FIND_LINKS`` environment variable to the
local directoy where your packages are. Then the plugin will do the following for you: 

- set the environment variable ``VIRTUALENV_NO_DOWNLOAD``, 
- create a ``pip.conf`` file for each testenv created with *no-index* option set and *find-links* option to point to the local directory you specified in ``TOX_PLUGIN_FIND_LINKS``, 
- create a ``disutils.cfg`` file for each testenv created by tox to tell ``easy_install`` to find packages in the local directory you specified.


Installation
------------

::

    $ pip install tox-no-internet
    # just use tox as you usually would
    $ tox ...

This tox plugin is inspired by Anthony Sottile's `tox-virtualenv-no-download <https://github.com/asottile/tox-virtualenv-no-download>`__.
